# Optimizing for Pimax

### Build Settings

In 'Edit->Project Settings->Quality' it is recommended to set 'Anti Aliasing' to 'Disabled'. This can reduce rendering costs significantly, and many VR projects benefit from a crisper look.

### Extremely low FPS

If Pimax is showing very few frames per second, in even a simple program, it may be a technical issue. [Consider consulting the troubleshooting page here](/docs/troubleshooting.md).
