# Pimax Unity SDK Instructions

> These instructions are relevant to PVR SDK version 1.1.2

Instructions for how to create new Unity virtual reality experiences for the Pimax (or port existing ones).

These guides primarily target the Pimax 5k Headset for desktop applications and games, although other devices using the same SDK will generally be supported. For controllers and base stations this documentation and example projects will be working from the HTC vive and SteamVR.
