# Understanding PiTool

> This guide is up to date until PiTool version 1.0.0.132

PiTool is the Pimax headsets companion application. It must be running if the Pimax hardware is to be used, and acts as both an interface between other hardware and as a manager to enable Pimax specific functionality.

## Installing PiTool

PiTool can be installed from the PiMax website, [Here.](https://pimaxvr.com/pages/pitool)

As well as installing PiTool is highly reccomended that your NVIDIA Graphics Card drivers be updated to their latest availible version. If an update was applied you should also perform a full restart on your system before attempting to use the PiMax, to allow the changes to take effect.

From the PiMax website you should be able to download an installer for PiTools named **'PiToolSetup_-version number-.exe'**. Once opened follow the installation instructions, including selecting a Language and selecting whether to create a desktop shortcut. After a breif installation procedure the installer will close, and allow you to open PiTools for use.

If you allowed the installer to do so, a shortcut to **PiTool** will appear on your computers Desktop. PiTool may also launch automatically when a PiMax headset is connected to your computer on startup.
