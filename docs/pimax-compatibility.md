# Pimax Compatiblity

### HTC/Valve Vive

Pimax is compatible with all HTC Vive devices. this includes base stations in all versions, all controllers, and as of the time of writing Pimax depends on Steam VR to run the majority of it's VR experiences.

### Oculus, Windows Mixed Reality

By default Oculus and Windows MR are not supported by Pimax at all. However games produced for these platforms with OpenVR, or another multiplatform solution, will still work for Pimax if they could be made to work with the Vive.
